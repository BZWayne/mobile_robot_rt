## About this course

Professor: [Carmine Tommaso Recchiuto](https://github.com/CarmineD8)

This course is oriented to learn Robotics Tools such as Python, C++, ROS/ROS2. As every course, it considers midterm assignments:

### Assignment 1: Python Robotics Simulation
The first task is in /robot_simulation folder. This is a simple, portable robot simulator developed by Student Robotics. Some of the arenas and the exercises have been modified for the Research Track I course. The detailed explaination of this task is in that folder. 

#### Problem
The robot is the same one that you have used in the previous exercises (exercise1.py, exercise2.py, exercise3.py). 

The only difference is that now the sensors
can detect boxes around all directions (from -180.0 degrees to 180.0 degrees).
Write a python script for achieving this robotâ€™s behaviour:
- constrantly drive the robot around the circuit in the counter-clockwise direction
- avoid touching the golden boxes
- when the robot is close to a silver box, it should grab it, and move it behind itself

#### Results
The video result of the first assignment is uploaded to my YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/UXKGQzI_MYQ
